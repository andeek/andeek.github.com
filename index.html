		<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University.</p>
		<p>I completed my M.A. in Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin under the direction of 
		John Luecke and  Martha Smith in Fall 2010. My M.A. report, An Overview of Multilevel Regression, 
		serves as an introduction to multilevel models and their comparison to Ordinary Least Squares regression
		using methods implimented in R. I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a certificate in Computing in May 2006 
		from The University of Texas at Austin.
