		<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University.</p>
		<p>I completed my M.S. in Statistics at Iowa State University working with Heike Hofmann and Dan Nordman in the Spring of 2014 and my M.A. in Mathematics at The University of Texas at Austin under the direction of John Luecke and  Martha Smith in Fall 2010. I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a certificate in Computing in May 2006 from The University of Texas at Austin.

      I'm interested in the intersection of Statistics and Computing, with a particular penchant for statistical graphics and reproducibility. I like struggling with JavaScript and learning new languages, R being my first love.

		<p>When I can, I enjoy racing cyclocross in the fall and cooking/eating delicious food year-round.</p>
