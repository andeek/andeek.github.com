		<p><strong>Stat 500. Statistical Methods.</strong> Introduction to methods for analyzing data from experiments and observational data. Design-based and model-based inference. Estimation, hypothesis testing, and model assessment for 2 group and k group studies. Experimental design and the use of pairing/blocking. Analysis of discrete data. Correlation and regression, prediction, model selection and diagnostics. Simple mixed models including nested random effects and split plot experimental designs. Use of the SAS statistical software.</p>
		<p><strong>Stat 511. Statistical Methods.</strong> Introduction to the general theory of linear models, least squares and maximum likelihood estimation, hypothesis testing, interval estimation and prediction, analysis of unbalanced designs. Models with both fixed and random factors. Introduction to non-linear and generalized linear models, bootstrap estimation, smoothing methods. Requires use of R statistical software.</p>
		<p><strong>Stat 542. Theory of Probability and Statistics I.</strong> Sample spaces, probability, conditional probability; Random variables, univariate distributions, expectation, median, and other characteristics of distributions, moment generating functions; Joint distributions, conditional distributions and independence, correlation and covariance; Probability laws and transformations; Introduction to the Multivariate Normal distribution; Sampling distributions, order statistics; Convergence concepts, the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and delta method; Basics of stochastic simulation.</p>
		<p><strong>Stat 543. Theory of Probability and Statistics II.</strong> Point estimation including method of moments, maximum likelihood estimation, exponential family, Bayes estimators, Loss function and Bayesian optimality, unbiasedness, sufficiency, completeness, Basu's theorem; Interval estimation including confidence intervals, prediction intervals, Bayesian interval estimation; Hypothesis testing including Neyman-Pearson Lemma, uniformly most powerful tests, likelihood ratio tests; Bayesian tests; Large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators and likelihood ratio tests; Nonparametric methods, bootstrap.</p>
		<p><strong>Stat 544. Bayesian Statistics.</strong> Specification of probability models; subjective, conjugate, and noninformative prior distributions; hierarchical models; analytical and computational techniques for obtaining posterior distributions; model checking, model selection, diagnostics; comparison of Bayesian and traditional methods.</p>
		<p><strong>Stat 579. An Introduction to R.</strong> An introduction to the logic of programming, numerical algorithms, and graphics. The R statistical programming environment will be used to demonstrate how data can be stored, manipulated, plotted, and analyzed using both built-in functions and user extensions. Concepts of modularization, looping, vectorization, conditional execution, and function construction will be emphasized.</p>
