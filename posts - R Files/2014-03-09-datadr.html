title: &ldquo;Reading: datadr - Divide and Recombine in R&rdquo;
root: &ldquo;../../../../&rdquo;</p>

<h2>comments: true</h2>

<p>As part of the course <a href="http://dicook.github.io/stat585/">Stat 585X</a> I am taking this semester, I will be posting a series of responses to assigned course readings. Mostly these will be my rambling thoughts as I skim papers.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This week we are reading documentation on the <a href="http://hafen.github.io/datadr/">datadr</a> package by Ryan Hafen from February 2014. This tutorial lay outs the introduction to the new package <em>datadr</em> as well as some background on the Divide-Recombine strategy that the package is built upon.</p>

<p>###Divide and Recombine (or is it S-A-C?)
The <strong>divide and recombine (D-R)</strong> strategy is very similar to something we have talked about recently: the Split-Apply-Combine paradigm. In fact, the two seem almost identical. The D-R strategy is to take a dataset, split it in a logical way into many chunks (<strong>divide</strong>) and then fit them back together after applying some transformation or summary (<strong>recombine</strong>). Sound familiar? This is the same idea as the S-A-C paradigm, except recombine encombasses both the <strong>apply</strong> and <strong>combine</strong> steps.</p>

<p><img src="{{ page.root }}images/blog/2014-03-09-datadr/D-R_S-A-C.png" alt="Divide-recombine vs. Split-combine-apply strategy" style="width: 500px;"/></p>

<p>###Birds of a feather&hellip;
So we have a package (<em>datadr</em>) based on the D-R strategy and multiple packages (<em>plyr</em>, <em>dplyr</em>) based on the S-A-C paradigm, which are essentially the same thing. What&#39;s the difference between the packages? I would say in some ways <em>datadr</em> is more similar to <em>dplyr</em> than <em>plyr</em>, because</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em>datadr</em>, divisions are data objects that persist. The authors did this because with very large data, computing a division is expensive compared to recombination. This is similar to <em>dplyr</em> in that we can create an object with the <em>group_by()</em> function that persists. Often we will use the chaining methods with the <em>%.%</em> operator, but if splitting is an expensive operation and we may want to use the splits with different apply statements, keeping the splits around makes sense.</li>
<li>Both <em>datadr</em> and <em>dplyr</em> allow for use of the same interface with different backends. For example, <em>dplyr</em> is easily used with data in R memory, or with data from a MySQL, SQLite, or postgreSQL database. Similarly, <em>datadr</em> can be used with data in R memory, or with data in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), RHIPE, or Hadoop MapReduce setup. Since <em>datadr</em> is already compatible with Hadoop, it would appear that this package has the one up on being able to handle truly <strong>huge</strong> datasets.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, <em>datadr</em> uses key-value pairs as its underlying data structure, which can be arranged in list form. <em>dplyr</em> is limited to using a data frame input and output. In this way <em>datadr</em> has some similarity to the <em>plyr</em> package.</p>
