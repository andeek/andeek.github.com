As part of the course [Stat 585X](http://dicook.github.io/stat585/) I am taking this semester, I will be posting a series of responses to assigned course readings. Mostly these will be my rambling thoughts as I skim papers.

This week we are reading ["From S to R - 35 Years of AT&T Leadership in Statistical Computing"](http://www.research.att.com/articles/featured_stories/2013_09/201309_SandR.html?fbid=40AAiV4amcU) by AT&T Staff, with Rick Becker and Simon Urbanek, an article from October 2013. This article chronicles the history of both S and R and introduces a new addition to the R community, RCloud, an open source collaborative environment developed at AT&T.

### A long long time ago...
...in a laboratory far far away...

R was born. At least this is how I imagine it happened. 

In the article, the authors claim that first a language *S* was written from Fortran in an AT&T Lab in order to help data analysts avoid writing pesky subroutines. From there, *S* was improved upon and sold, becoming *SPlus*. Finally, an open source version *R* being written from scratch by two professors, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, in order to reach students.

I like my version better.

### RCloud-y with a chance of collaboration
Since then, *R* has grown to have a much larger usership than *SPlus*. One of *R*'s biggest strengths is its extensibility. This is made possible by how easy it is to write packages for *R* and share your code with the world through code repositories like CRAN or github.

AT&T labs have again made a contribution to the language in the form of a collaborative notebook environment for *R* called [RCloud](https://github.com/att/rcloud). *RCloud* sounds to me like a cross between a github repository of code and a shiny application, acting on a server and allowing multiple users to contribute as well as see results. I look forward to trying it out.
