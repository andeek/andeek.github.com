<p>As part of the course <a href="http://dicook.github.io/stat585/">Stat 585X</a> I am taking this semester, I will be posting a series of responses to assigned course readings. Mostly these will be my rambling thoughts as I skim papers.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This week we are reading <a href="http://www.research.att.com/articles/featured_stories/2013_09/201309_SandR.html?fbid=40AAiV4amcU">&ldquo;From S to R - 35 Years of AT&amp;T Leadership in Statistical Computing&rdquo;</a> by AT&amp;T Staff, with Rick Becker and Simon Urbanek, an article from October 2013. This article chronicles the history of both S and R and introduces a new addition to the R community, RCloud, an open source collaborative environment developed at AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>###A long long time ago&hellip;
&hellip;in a laboratory far far away&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="{{ page.root }}images/blog/2014-02-25-FromStoR/birthofR.png" alt="Yum" style="width: 500px;"/></p>

<p>R was born. At least this is how I imagine it happened. </p>

<p>In the article, the authors claim that first a language <em>S</em> was written from Fortran in an AT&amp;T Lab in order to help data analysts avoid writing pesky subroutines. From there, <em>S</em> was improved upon and sold, becoming <em>SPlus</em>. Finally, an open source version <em>R</em> being written from scratch by two professors, Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, in order to reach students.</p>

<p>I like my version better.</p>

<p>###RCloud-y with a chance of collaboration
Since then, <em>R</em> has grown to have a much larger usership than <em>SPlus</em>. One of <em>R</em>&#39;s biggest strengths is its extensibility. This is made possible by how easy it is to write packages for <em>R</em> and share your code with the world through code repositories like CRAN or github.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T labs have again made a contribution to the language in the form of a collaborative notebook environment for <em>R</em> called <a href="https://github.com/att/rcloud">RCloud</a>. <em>RCloud</em> sounds to me like a cross between a github repository of code and a shiny application, acting on a server and allowing multiple users to contribute as well as see results. I look forward to trying it out.</p>
