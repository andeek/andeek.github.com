As part of the course [Stat 585X](http://dicook.github.io/stat585/) I am taking this semester, I will be posting a series of responses to assigned course readings. Mostly these will be my rambling thoughts as I skim papers.

This week we are reading ["The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis"](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper) by Hadley Wickham, published in the Journal of Statistical Software, April 2011, Volume 40, Issue 1. This paper details the split-apply-combine strategy in data analysis and its implementation in R in a package called *plyr*. 


### Split-Apply-Combine
I posit that the split-apply-combine strategy is useful in a much larger realm than data analysis. I liken it to the idea of 'divide and conquer'. The idea is to **split** up a large task into smaller, bite-sized chunks, **apply** the solution on each piece independently, and then **combine** these little pieces back into the final result. Of course, we can accomplish this with base R functions, but *plyr* provides a very intuitive command structure and naming consistency, not to mention it lessens the number of lines of code I have to write.

So what does it truly mean to split-combine-apply? What are we splitting? The easiest way I can illustrate the idea is with the concept of a data frame. Imagine we have a data frame with three columns: an identity, a group, and a metric. We may want to know how many identities there are in each group, or maybe we want to know the sum of the metric values within each group. The split-apply-combine strategy will allow us to do this in the following manner:

It's easiest to conceptualize *plyr*-ing a data frame because it's two dimensional. Of course, we can apply the split-apply-combine strategy to objects of more than one dimension. Hadley explains this idea very thoroughly with great images in the paper and I recommend the read if you are using more complicated data structures.

### From what to what?
As I mentioned, one of my favorite things about the *plyr* package is its intuitive naming structure. The way the functions within the package are named defines what data structure is being split [input] and then what format to combine the results into [output]. More specificaly, the functions used to split-apply-combine are names as *[input letter][output letter]ply*. There are three structures you can use as either input or output.

1. Arrays -- letter: a
2. Data frames -- letter: d
3. Lists -- letter: l

The type of input determines how the opject can be split and what kind of functions can be applied. For example, *ddply* takes a data frame as input and returns a data frame as output. This naming convention reduced confusion and time spent re-looking up helpfiles when I try to *plyr*.

### Tips Example
To show off the ease of the *plyr* solutions, I'd like to walk through a small example using the *tips* dataset from the [reshape2](http://andeekaplan.com/2013/01/14/ReadingReshape/) package. This is a dataset  with recorded information about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(reshape2)
head(tips)
```
Let's say we want to look at average tips earned on Fridays for the server. We could employ a subset strategy, like so:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(subset(tips, day == 'Fri')$tip)
```
But what about average tips for each day? I wouldn't want to have to do each day by hand. Instead, let's use *plyr*!
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(plyr)

ddply(tips, .(day), summarise, mean=mean(tip))
```
In the function call you can see we are specifying *day* to be the group variable and then we want to 'summarise' our dataset my displaying the mean tip for each day. We can also easily break this out by meal type.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ddply(tips, .(day, time), summarise, mean=mean(tip))
```
From here it's easy to see that larger tips happen at dinner and the server actually received his largest tips at dinner.

This is a small example of what we can do easily with *plyr*. But there is a vast expanse of things I haven't even touched on. 

### Something new
I have been using *plyr* for over a year now, but I learned something completely new from reading Hadley's paper. I didn't know that you can use formulas and renaming in the variable call to plyr. For example, say we wanted to group by "time_day" and call it "time" for whatever reason. This is possible with the same simple syntax.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
ddply(tips, .(time = paste(time, day, sep="_")), summarise, mean=mean(tip))
```
I know this is a completely contrived example, but I think this little nugget of knowledge could be really useful to me in the future.

### Commentary
I hope you get some good mileage out of the split-apply-combine strategy. I use it all the time and really enjoyed reading this paper to learn more deeply about the ideas underlying the *plyr* package. Let me know in the comments section how *plyr* is working for you!
